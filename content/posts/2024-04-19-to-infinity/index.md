## Let us begin
[hello, world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
has served us programmers well for many years, I have started manys the project or code repository with these exact words.

But times have changed and we have been inspired by great role models such as Buzz Lightyear urging us to reach for the stars with his iconic phrase "To infinity and beyond..."

This is about committing to an idea or objective and going all-in --  when you do that, sometimes, *great* things happen!
