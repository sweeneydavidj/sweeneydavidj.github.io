## Let us begin
[hello, world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_World!%22_program)
has served us programmers well for many years, I have started lots of projects and code repositories with these exact words.

But times have changed and we have been inspired by great role models such as Buzz Lightyear urging us to reach for the stars with his iconic phrase "To infinity and beyond..."

This is about committing to an idea or objective and going all-in --  when you do that, sometimes, *great* things happen!

So the next time you're printing that first message to the console in a new language or committing the first code to a new repository I suggest you dispense with the traditional "hello, world" or "initial commit" in favour of "To infinity and beyond..." -- with a start like that the sky is the limit!
